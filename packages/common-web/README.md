# Zajno's Toolbox – Web

Moved from [Zajno/common-web](https://github.com/Zajno/common-web).

This library is an extension for [`@zajno/common`](../common), which adds more tools for Web development (mostly based on browser features).

All runtime dependencies are peer.

### Contents

* [Storage](./src/storage) – local/session storage wrappers with a common interface (see [storage abstractions](../common//src/storage/abstractions.ts))

* [Breakpoints](./src/breakpoints/index.ts) – configurable responsive breakpoints manager
