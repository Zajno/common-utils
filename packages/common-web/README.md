# Zajno's Toolbox – Web

Moved from [Zajno/common-web](https://github.com/Zajno/common-web).

This library is an extension for [`@zajno/common`](https://github.com/Zajno/common-utils), which adds more tools for Web development (mostly based on browser features).

All runtime dependencies are peer.

### Contents
